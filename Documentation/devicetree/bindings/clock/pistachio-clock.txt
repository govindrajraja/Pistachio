* IMG Pistachio SoC clock controllers

Pistachio has three clock controllers (core clock, peripheral clock, and
peripheral control) which are instantiated individually from the device-tree.

External clocks:

There are four external inputs to the clock controllers which should
be defined with the following clock-output-names:
- "xtal": External 52Mhz oscillator (required)
- "audio_refclk": Alternate audio reference clock (optional)
- "ext_enet_in": Alternate ethernet PHY clock (optional)

Top-level control:

The top level control block contains miscellaneous control registers and gates
for the external clocks audio_refclk and ext_enet_in.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must include "img,pistachio-cr-top"
- reg: Must contain the base address and length of the top-level
  control registers.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each clock in clock-names.
- clock-names: Two optional clocks, "audio_refclk" and "ext_enet_in" (see
  "External clocks")
- #clock-cells: Must be 1.  The single cell is the clock identifier.
  See dt-bindings/clock/pistachio-clk.h for the list of valid identifiers.

Example:
	clk_top: clk_top@18144800 {
		compatible = "img,pistachio-cr-top";
		reg = <0x18149000 0x200>;
		clocks = <&audio_refclk &ext_enet_in>;
		clock-names = "audio_refclk", "ext_enet_in";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

Core clock controller:

The core clock controller generates clocks for the CPU, RPU (WiFi + BT
co-processor), audio, and several peripherals.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "img,pistachio-clk".
- reg: Must contain the base address and length of the core clock controller.
- #clock-cells: Must be 1.  The single cell is the clock identifier.
  See dt-bindings/clock/pistachio-clk.h for the list of valid identifiers.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each clock in clock-names.
- clock-names: Must include "xtal" (see "External clocks") and
  "audio_refclk_ext_gate", "ext_enet_in_gate" which are generated by the
  top level control.

Example:
	clk_core: clk_core@18144000 {
		compatible = "img,pistachio-clk";
		reg = <0x18144000 0x800>;
		clocks = <&osc &clk_top EXT_CLK_AUDIO_IN
			&clk_top EXT_CLK_ENET_IN>;
		clock-names = "xtal", "audio_refclk_ext_gate",
			"ext_enet_in_gate";

		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

Peripheral clock controller:

The peripheral clock controller generates clocks for the DDR, ROM, and other
peripherals.  The peripheral system clock ("periph_sys_core") generated by
the core clock controller is the input clock to the peripheral clock controller.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "img,pistachio-periph-clk".
- reg: Must contain the base address and length of the peripheral clock
  controller.
- #clock-cells: Must be 1.  The single cell is the clock identifier.
  See dt-bindings/clock/pistachio-clk.h for the list of valid identifiers.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each clock in clock-names.
- clock-names: Must include "periph_sys_core", the peripheral system clock
  generated by the core clock controller.

Example:
	clk_periph: clk_periph@18144800 {
		compatible = "img,pistachio-clk-periph";
		reg = <0x18144800 0x800>;
		clocks = <&clk_core CLK_PERIPH_SYS_CORE>;
		clock-names = "periph_sys_core";

		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

Peripheral general control:

The peripheral general control block generates system interface clocks and
resets for various peripherals.  It also contains miscellaneous peripheral
control registers.  The peripheral system clock ("periph_sys") generated by
the peripheral clock controller is the input clock to the system clock
controller.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must include "img,pistachio-cr-periph" and "syscon".
- reg: Must contain the base address and length of the peripheral general
  control registers.
- #clock-cells: Must be 1.  The single cell is the clock identifier.
  See dt-bindings/clock/pistachio-clk.h for the list of valid identifiers.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each clock in clock-names.
- clock-names: Must include "sys", the peripheral system clock
  generated by the peripheral clock controller.

Example:
	clk_sys: clk_sys@18144800 {
		compatible = "img,pistachio-cr-periph";
		reg = <0x18148000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&clk_periph PERIPH_CLK_SYS>;
		clock-names = "sys";

		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};
